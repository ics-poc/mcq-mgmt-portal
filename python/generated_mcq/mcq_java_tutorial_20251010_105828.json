1 Object Oriented 2 Platform Independent 3 Simple 4 Secure 5 Architecture-neutral 6 Portable 7 Robust 8 Multithreaded 9 Interpreted 10 High Performance 11 Distributed 12 Dynamic Object Oriented In Java, everything is an Object Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model As a language that has the Object-Oriented feature, Java supports the following fundamental concepts of OOPs Polymorphism Inheritance Encapsulation Abstraction Classes Objects Instance Method Message Passing 3 Java - Features Java Tutorial 9 Platform Independent Unlike many other programming languages including C and C , when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine It is compiled into platform independent byte code This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on Java is designed in Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) way Code written in Java is not directly dependent on the type of machine it is running A code in Java is compiled in ByteCode which is platform independent Java Virtual Machine (JVM) can understand the byte code Java provides platform specific JVMs It is the responsibility of platform specific JVM to interpret the byte code correctly thus developers are free to write code without worrying about platforms like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc This feature makes Java a platform neutral language Byte code can be distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on It makes java code highly portable and useful for application running on multiple platforms Simple Java is designed to be easy to learn If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master Java is very easy to learn It inherits many features from C, C and removes complex features like pointers, operator overloading, multiple inheritance, explicit memory allocation etc It provides automatic garbage collection With a rich set of libraries with thousands of useful functions, Java makes developers life easy Secure With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption Java is by design highly secure as it is not asking developers to interact with underlying system memory or operation system Bytecode is secure and several security flaws like buffer overflow, memory leak are very rare Java exception handling mechanism allows developers to handle almost all type of error exceptions which can happen during program execution Automatic garbage collection helps in maintaining the system memory space utilization in check Architecture-neutral Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system With advancement in processor architectures or machine specific processors, Java code remains independent of any specific requirement of a processor As java is an open standard, even a specific JVM can be prepared for a custom architecture As in today's time, we've JVM available for almost all popular platforms, architectures, Java code is completely independent For example, a Java program created in Windows machine can run on Linux machine without any code modification Java Tutorial 10 Portable Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable Compiler in Java is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset Due to this portability, Java was an instant hit since inception",

1 Object Oriented 2 Platform Independent 3 Simple 4 Secure 5 Architecture-neutral 6 Portable 7 Robust 8 Multithreaded 9 Interpreted 10 High Performance 11 Distributed 12 Dynamic Object Oriented In Java, everything is an Object Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model As a language that has the Object-Oriented feature, Java supports the following fundamental concepts of OOPs Polymorphism Inheritance Encapsulation Abstraction Classes Objects Instance Method Message Passing 3 Java - Features Java Tutorial 9 Platform Independent Unlike many other programming languages including C and C , when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine It is compiled into platform independent byte code This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on Java is designed in Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) way Code written in Java is not directly dependent on the type of machine it is running A code in Java is compiled in ByteCode which is platform independent Java Virtual Machine (JVM) can understand the byte code Java provides platform specific JVMs It is the responsibility of platform specific JVM to interpret the byte code correctly thus developers are free to write code without worrying about platforms like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc This feature makes Java a platform neutral language Byte code can be distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on It makes java code highly portable and useful for application running on multiple platforms Simple Java is designed to be easy to learn If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master Java is very easy to learn It inherits many features from C, C and removes complex features like pointers, operator overloading, multiple inheritance, explicit memory allocation etc It provides automatic garbage collection With a rich set of libraries with thousands of useful functions, Java makes developers life easy Secure With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption Java is by design highly secure as it is not asking developers to interact with underlying system memory or operation system Bytecode is secure and several security flaws like buffer overflow, memory leak are very rare Java exception handling mechanism allows developers to handle almost all type of error exceptions which can happen during program execution Automatic garbage collection helps in maintaining the system memory space utilization in check Architecture-neutral Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system With advancement in processor architectures or machine specific processors, Java code remains independent of any specific requirement of a processor As java is an open standard, even a specific JVM can be prepared for a custom architecture As in today's time, we've JVM available for almost all popular platforms, architectures, Java code is completely independent For example, a Java program created in Windows machine can run on Linux machine without any code modification Java Tutorial 10 Portable Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable Compiler in Java is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset Due to this portability, Java was an instant hit since inception",
