app): A computer program or software that is designed to perform a specific digital task, typically used or run by an end-user In this digital age, customers expect applications to be intuitive, well-functioning, and efficient Application programming interface (API) A piece of software that interfaces with or connects different applications and enables information to flow between systems Unlike a user interface, which connects a computer to a person, an API connects computers or pieces of software to each other One purpose of APIs is to hide the internal details of how a system works, exposing only those parts a developer wants to allow a user or program to interface with In this way APIs can help organizations to adapt to modern business needs by allowing access to older legacy

VMs because they do not recreate a full representation of the hardware, but only recreate or virtualize the operating system Hybrid cloud: An IT infrastructure that combines on-premises infrastructure with cloud infrastructure, allowing organizations to leverage the benefits of both environments Kubernetes: An open source cluster management system that provides automated container orchestration Multi-cloud: An IT infrastructure that uses multiple public cloud providers, such as Google Cloud, to achieve greater flexibility, scalability, and cost savings Rehosting: Moving an application or system from one environment to another, such as from on-premises to the cloud, without making any changes to the application or system itself Serverless computing: A cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider allocates machine resources on demand and takes care of the servers on behalf of their customers Businesses provide code for the function that they want to run and the cloud provider handles all infrastructure management Resources such as compute power are automatically provisioned behind the scenes as needed Virtual machines (VM) A VM is a virtualized instance of a server that re-creates the functionality of a dedicated physical server It uses a partitioned space inside a physical server which makes it easy to optimize and reallocate resources and allow multiple

their infrastructure s multiple built-in security layers Encryption: The process of encoding data stored in the cloud to safeguard it from unauthorized access Least privilege model: A security principle that grants users only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks Malware: Software designed to harm a computer system, such as viruses, ransomware, and spyware Phishing: An attempt to obtain personal information or credentials by sending fraudulent emails or messages Privacy: The data an organization or an individual has access to, and who they can share that data with SecOps: A collaborative approach to security that combines IT security and operations teams Security: The policies, procedures, and controls put in place to keep data and infrastructure safe Two-step verification: A security measure that requires users to enter a second verification code, such as a code sent to their phone, in addition to their password to log in Zero trust model: A security approach that assumes no entity or user is trustworthy and requires continuous verification before granting access 25 Course 6 DevOps: Developer operations A philosophy that seeks to create a more

teams Five objectives of DevOps include reducing silos, accepting failure as normal, implementing gradual change, leveraging tooling and automation, and measuring everything Latency: The time it takes for a system to respond to a request Log file: A text file where applications (including the operating system) write events Log files make it easier for developers, DevOps, and system administrators to get insights and identify the root cause of issues within applications and the infrastructure Logging: A process that allows IT teams to analyze selected logs and accelerate application troubleshooting Monitoring: Gathering predefined sets of metrics or logs Monitoring is the foundation for site reliability engineering because it provides visibility into the performance, uptime, and overall health of cloud powered applications Resource hierarchy: How an IT team can organize a business s Google Cloud environment and how that service structure maps to the organization s actual structure It determines what resources users can access Saturation: The point at which a system is no longer able to handle any more requests SLA (Service Level Agreement): A contract between a service provider and a customer that specifies the level of service that will be provided SLI (Service Level Indicator): A quantitative measure of a particular aspect of service performance, such as latency or error rate SLO (Service Level Objective): A target for a particular SLI, such as a maximum latency of 200 milliseconds SRE: Site reliability engineering A discipline that applies aspects of software engineering to operations The goals of SRE are to create scalable and highly reliable software systems Best practices central to SRE align with DevOps objectives Traffic: The amount of data or number of requests that a system is handling 26 List of Google products and solutions Learn more about Google Cloud products at cloud google com products Learn more about Google Cloud solutions at
